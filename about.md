I am a software engineer with a love of learning. My current experience is in buiding scalable maintainable enterprise systems for affecting change in an organization's application ecosystem mainly through the use of continuous integration and continous deployment/delivery. I am interested in developing these systems to help teams and organizations operate more efficiently by providing them with stable data driven platforms and workflows which allow them to release their developments quickly with as little interaction as possible. 

I am also a student of the machine learning field and am currently pursuing my Master's degree with a specialization in ML from Georgia Institute of Technology. Machine learning has enormous potential in a variety of fields. It is my hope to be able to use my passion for machine learning to enhance the systems I develop in order to maximize their potential.
